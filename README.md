# YouTube-Downloader

This is a YouTube video Downloader I created using the pytube python library.

To download a YouTube video copy the video link then run the python file in the terminal followed by the link.

For example: 

```bash
python ytDownloader.py "insert link here"
````

This will automatically downloaded the highest quality of video and place it in the directory you specified by changing line 13.
